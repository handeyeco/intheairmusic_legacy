		Two years after the release of "<a href="releases.html#for_torching" target="_top">For Torching</a>," Matthew Curtis (under the alias The Dronings) brings to the table a new collection of songs inspired by and created during his long transition from rural East Texas to the thriving music scene of Austin, TX. While there haven't been any official releases by the psychedelic troubadour until now, he has not been foregoing musical responsibilities but instead took time to travel Texas, sharing music and writing about his experiences, before finally settling in Austin. The songs on "LCD" represent this transition. "For Sam (Who Painted Me A Picture)" is a platonic love song that swims in imaginative naivety about his time spent with a childhood friend while traveling. "Tough" and "Lips Half Parted" (featuring another Austin favorite, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Melissa-Engleman/56290254472" target="_blank">Melissa Engleman</a>) represent the hardships of his new found relationships while the title track contains all the playfulness and excitement of developing friendships (and lyrically playing on his often melodramatic tendencies). Never concerned with category, or even consistency for that matter, The Dronings bring fresh instrumentation and experimentation while desperately grasping for and trying to abandon pop sensibilities.</div>

					<p>The third release by Matthew Curtis as The Dronings. Matthew trades his harmonica for a kazoo, keeps the theme of unrequited love while adding fun-loving beach songs, and all the while develops his strange love for experimentation in the realm of dreamy, lo-fi folk.</p>

		Fearlessly building his musical foundation from a rich history of Texas country, folk, blues, and rock 
music, James Derek has become part of a rare breed of musician that forgoes the restrictions of genre 
classification and instead opts to forge his songs with raw, insightful lyrics, playful guitar work, 
and an air of disregard towards making music that can be easily locked into arbitrary subcategories. 
This sense of freedom is encapsulated in each and every song recorded for Derek's debut EP with In The Air Music; "Old Soul" begins quite light-heartedly, giving the listener the feeling of fresh freedom, 
but as the EP progresses, we learn about the complexities of being a lone-wanderer as told through 
Derek's sorrowful, bluesy, mid-album tracks. However, "Old Soul" ends with a sigh of comforted relief 
as Derek suggests that maybe these restrictions and complications are in fact our own creation, all of 
which can be quelled by taking the time to enjoy life's simple pleasures.

					<p>With witty lyricism and soulful guitar work, James Derek channels what it means to grow up in Small Town, USA; and yet, at the root, these songs are not so much about rural East Texas, but about growth, hardship, and, above all, having fun in the midst of obstacles.</p>

		A whirlwind of emotion under subdued vocals, producer/songwriter Matthew Curtis, under the alias The Dronings, created a winding road of musical twists and turns with his debut album "For Torching", In The Air Music's first full-length release. The album starts off simple; catchy, and often childlike, vocals over subtle layers of folk instrumentation. The first three songs set a mood that carries throughout the majority of the album and seem to set a precedent for the instrumentation as well, but as "Quarter Past Three" seamlessly transforms into "Be Free" the album makes it's first hint at an upcoming stream of oddball arrangement and non-traditional instrument choice. In fact the next three songs almost abandon acoustic guitar altogether as the tables turn towards over effected electrics, analog drum machines and rhythm boxes, and 60's style modular synthesis. After six songs told from Matthew's perspective, the album takes another drastic change when taken over by an anonymous storyteller that provides a fresh angle to the human condition and allows Matthew to explore the wild frontier of soundscape. The story ends in an all out explosion when the singer regains the reins for the album's conclusion.

				<p>Debut, full-length album for The Dronings (the vehicle for producer/songwriter Matthew Curtis), "For Torching" is a unique blend of folksy strumming, psychedelic trips, and sonic experimentation. Matthew whispers introspective insights over swirling guitars, modular synthesizers, and classic movie samples to texturally decorate his exploration of the human condition.</p>

		In an effort to abandon previous methods of production and to establish a new sound for himself, Matthew Curtis gave up any preconceived notion for what music was to him to record this collection of sonic experiments. Matthew (who now works under the alias The Dronings) traded his laptop for a busted four-track cassette recorder, his midi-controller for an out-of-tune piano, and his synthesizers for a pawn-shop guitar and approached the recording of "City of Power" more as a class in recording technique than as the creation of a commercial release. Pleased with the odd result however, he released the EP to the public as a showcase of where his later ideas stemmed from.

		Second Act Overture hit the IDM scene in 2007 with his first EP "Ode to Strings" (originally released on <a href="http://spoomusic.com/" target="_blank">sp00 music</a>). Exploring his own world of digital orchestration, Second Act Overture eloquently brings classical inspiration to an electronic world. A must listen is "Entr'acte", which takes the listen on a musical trip of epic proportions.
