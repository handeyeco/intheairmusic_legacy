<h3>LCD</h3>

<p>I, I'm burnt out<br>
I'll let the sun swallow me up<br>
I'm goin' out<br><br>

I, I'm drowning<br>
My cares all way down there<br>
I'm goin' out<br><br>

Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey<br><br>

(Come on!)<br><br>

I, I'm washed up<br>
I'll let the waves take me away<br>
I'm goin' out<br><br>

I, I'm sinking<br>
My fingers in the sand<br>
I'm goin' out<br><br>

Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey</p>

<h3>Lips Half Parted [Part 1]</h3>

<p>You saw the stars in my eyes<br>
They matched the black holes in thine<br>
Please take your time<br><br>

You serve the drinks, so eloquent<br>
Flirt with the boys to make rent<br>
Drown drinks they've sent<br><br>

(And you sing)<br><br>

Come all you sailors to my sea<br>
Come all you lovers drink with me<br>
I'll take your ship<br>
I'll sail away<br>
I need you now<br>
Please come today<br>
Come all you sailors to my sea<br><br>

You saw the stars in my eyes<br>
They matched the black holes in thine<br>
Please take your time<br><br>

(And you sing)<br><br>

Come all you sailors to my sea<br>
Come all you lovers drink with me<br>
I'll take your ship<br>
I'll sail away<br>
I need you now<br>
Please come today<br>
Come all you sailors to my sea</p>

<h3>For Sam (Who Painted Me A Picture) [Part 2]</h3>

<p>Sam, Sam I have a plan<br>
We'll dip our feet in pearly white sand<br>
Or walk off shore forgetting the land<br>
O Sam, Sam<br><br>

Sam, Sam I gotta say<br>
I'm tired of working these twelve hour days<br>
I'd rather be working on getting more play<br>
O Sam, Sam<br><br>

Sam, Sam I see it now<br>
We'll drink ourselves blind out on the town<br>
We'll make it home but won't know how<br>
O Sam, Sam<br><br>

Sam, Sam I have a plan<br>
I'll find a woman and you'll find a man<br>
We'll move near each other and won't life be grand<br>
O Sam, Sam<br><br>

Sam, Sam I gotta say<br>
I look forward to seeing you everyday<br>
Spending the weekends under the shade<br>
O Sam, Sam<br><br>

Sam, Sam I see it now<br>
You in your suit and me in my gown<br>
Sipping chardonnay when no one's around<br>
O Sam, Sam</p>

<h3>Some Call It Love</h3>

<p>I think you are swell<br>
Didn't you know?<br>
I'd like to know you well<br>
Doesn't it show?<br>
I'd like to show you my drawings of us together<br><br>

I wish you were mine<br>
Not too much to ask<br>
I ask all the time<br>
And this won't be the last<br>
Last night I watched you sleeping and it was the greatest night of my life<br><br>

Some call it obsession<br>
I call it love<br>
Some say an infatuation<br>
I call it love<br>
Some say it's my only passion<br>
I call it love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love<br>
Some call it obsession<br>
I call it love<br>
Some say it's a complex<br>
I call it love<br>
Some say it's even a fetish<br>
I call it love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love<br><br>

I think you are swell<br>
Didn't you know?<br>
I'd like to know you well<br>
Doesn't it show?<br>
I'd like to show you my collection of your half eaten bagels<br><br>

I wish you were mine<br>
Not too much to ask<br>
I ask all the time<br>
And this won't be the last<br>
Last time I saw you I cut off a lock of your hair <br><br>

(Yes I did)<br><br>

Some call it obsession<br>
I call it love<br>
Some say it's a fixation<br>
I call it love<br>
Some say even a delusion<br>
I call it love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love<br>
Some call it obsession<br>
I call it love<br>
Some say it's neurosis<br>
I call it love<br>
Some call it a compulsion<br>
I call it love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love<br><br>

Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love</p>

<h3>Tough</h3>

<p>The only time that we were great<br>
Was when I served my head on a plate<br><br>

The only times you looked in my eyes<br>
Was when you were tryin' to spread your lies<br><br>

The only times you combed your hair<br>
Was when you said you were goin' nowhere<br><br>

The only times that we made love<br>
Was when you said that you had enough<br><br>

Was lovin' me really that tough?<br>
Was bein' with me really that rough?<br><br>

Was lovin' me really that tough?<br>
Was bein' with me really that rough?</p>

<h3>Remember Me [Part 2]</h3>

<p>It's like the movies<br>
Rainy and gloomy<br>
But here we are outside<br><br>

A famous Hitchcock<br>
You cryptically talk<br>
Relating storms to life<br><br>

And I don't know<br>
Where else I'd go<br><br>

Like those old films<br>
Rich dialog spills<br>
As the clouds pass<br><br>

Say "see I told you<br>
Those troubles own you<br>
But they won't last"<br><br>

And I don't know<br>
Where else I'd go<br>
If I should leave<br>
Remember me?<br><br>

Remember me</p>
