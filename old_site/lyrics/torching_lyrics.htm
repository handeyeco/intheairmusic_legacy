<h3>Forest Fire</h3>

<p>In the middle of a forest fire<br>
Watchin' flames gettin' higher and higher<br>
In the middle of a forest fire<br>
Just waitin' to die<br><br>

You may call me a liar<br>
In the middle of a forest fire<br>
There's nothing that's so dire<br>
As a slow suicide<br><br>

And I wait, wait, wait<br>
For that date, date, date<br>
When I cross that line<br>
When I cross that line<br><br>

In the middle of a forest fire<br>
And I feel so fucking tired<br>
In the middle of a forest fire<br>
Just waitin' to die<br><br>

Don't think I'll get much higher<br>
In the middle of a forest fire<br>
Won't hear no angel's choir<br>
For a slow suicide<br><br>

And I wait, wait, wait<br>
For that date, date, date<br>
When I cross that line<br>
When I cross that line</p>

<h3>Was This In Your Five Year Plan?</h3>

<p>I remember your five year plan<br>
Marked with bullets and written in pen<br>
It told us where we would be<br>
In a time of uncertainty<br><br>

I remember flippin' the pages<br>
And reading what it was saying<br>
I knew it'd never succeed<br>
Between you and me<br><br>

You and me<br><br>

You wanted to get married<br>
In a chapel far from the city<br>
I was afraid I'd catch on fire<br>
For walkin' in the house of liars<br><br>

I remember how you always smiled<br>
Face lit up like a child's<br>
Two dimples and beautiful eyes<br>
I knew I had to make you cry<br><br>

Make you cry<br>
I could die<br><br>

I remember when I knew it was over<br>
A pretty day in October<br>
Stole your nose and kissed your lips<br>
That's when you said that was it<br><br>

You rewrote your five year plan<br>
But it involved another man<br>
You think I ruined your life<br>
You only remember the fights<br><br>

That's alright</p>

<h3>Quarter Past Three / Be Free</h3>

</p>Each day is the same or so they say<br>
Waking up a quarter past three<br>
I'll get better I'll find a way<br>
A way for us to one day be free<br><br>

Tired of feeling so empty inside<br>
Going to bed a quarter past three<br>
Always looking for a new place to hide<br>
Can't figure out how to make a new me<br><br>

Things will go smoother but not today<br>
Staying awake through a quarter past three<br>
I'll get better, I'll find a way<br>
Find a new place for us to be free<br><br>

Be free</p>

<h3>Nothing Wrong</h3>

<p>I told her what I saw today<br>
People always in the way<br>
Mothers teach their daughters<br>
All their old mistakes<br><br>

She said there's nothing wrong with me<br>
She said there's nothing wrong with me<br>
She said there's nothing wrong with me<br>
She lied, yeah she lied<br><br>

Everyone must play the game<br>
Learn to make their dreams tame<br>
Fathers teach their sons<br>
How to hide the pain<br><br>

She said there's nothing wrong with me<br>
She said there's nothing wrong with me<br>
She said there's nothing wrong with me<br>
She lied, yeah she lied<br><br>

Do you want to be like them?<br>
Drones on the same stem?<br>
Following the rest<br>
To a lower plane?<br><br>

She said there's nothing wrong with me<br>
She said there's nothing wrong with me<br>
She said there's nothing wrong with me<br>
She lied, yeah she lied</p>

<h3>Keep Talking</h3>

<p>Let's keep talking<br>
I wanna know you more<br><br>

Keep on</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Sun</h3>

<p>Come on, come on<br>
Show us the way<br>
And like a dog<br>
I will obey<br><br>

Why does he watch<br>
If we are free?<br>
Why won't he leave<br>
And let us be?<br><br>

Do you see the sun?<br>
Do you see the waves upon the shore?<br>
Where could you run?<br>
Where can you hide anymore?<br><br>

Come on, come on, come on</p>
